# ShoppingManager

## Brainstorming Ideas:
1. Implement a command line interface that scrapes multiple E-commerce websites asuch as Amazon.com, Walmart.com, Macy.
  1a. Technologies and dependencies: Python, BeautifulSoup, Requests, Selenium. 
2. Price comparisons for user available at one place. 
3. Shopping cart that users can add. Use web automation techniques to automate adding shopping card items to checkouts. Only the final payment options will be inputed by the user. 
4. Use command line interface. After basic functionality is achieved, there is a plan to switch to GUI interface.
